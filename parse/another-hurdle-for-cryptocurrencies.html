<h1>Another hurdle for Cryptocurrencies</h1>

<p>As has been remarked elsewhere,
    I'm a proud nocoiner normie. But that doesn't mean that I'm not
    interested in the <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com"
    target="_new">worst excesses of cryptocurrencies and
    friends</a>.</p> <p>But rather than simply go
    over the arguments that have been <a
    href="https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog.html"
    target="_new">explained way better by others</a>, I've
    been pondering a small piece of the situation. It's fascinating
    in a way, because crypto seems to be one of those ideas that
    fractally wrong - if you look at the big picture, it's a bad
    idea, and if you zoom down into tiny details, there are lots of
    bad ideas in there too.</p> <p>One thing that
    occurred to me was that companies seem to be heading down the
    crypto currency route. <a
    href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60156682"
    target="_new">Facebook/Meta has Diem</a>, and other
    companies have theirs.</p> <p>Now, I know that
    <a
    href="https://uselessofblog.blogspot.com/p/proudly-serving.html"
    target="_new">the company I work for</a> doesn't have
    any stake in cryptocurrencies at the moment, which is all good.
    But what if it did? My contract of employment specifies how
    I'll be paid, which is nice. But say the following things
    happened:</p><p></p><ol style="text-align:
    left;"><li>The company creates its own cryptocurrency,
    called for the sake of argument
    "WorkCoin";</li><li>They decide that WorkCoin is
    now the currency used to denominate my
    salary;</li><li>They decide to pay me only in
    WorkCoin, rather than by BACS into my UK bank
    account.</li></ol><p></p> <p>This
    presents me with a problem. Yes, <i>technically</i>
    I'm being paid in a currency. However, WorkCoin is only
    convertible to goods and services at the whim of my employer,
    amongst many other enormous disadvantages of crypto. This means
    that I could, for instance, be forced to buy goods and services
    only through my employer or merchants that they have an
    agreement with. If I wanted to shop at my local artisanal
    laptop wright, but can only pay in non-convertible WorkCoin, I
    wouldn't be able to.</p> <p>This is a problem. But
    what can we do to prevent this nightmare scenario? To start
    answering the question, let us look back in time.</p>
    <p>This scenario is in fact very similar to a situation
    that existed for many people in the UK many years ago. In a
    factory town, often a currency controlled by the factory became
    a de facto currency in the area. Let's call this "WorkCoin".
    Now, you can only buy food in the factory shop, as that's a
    business that accepts WorkCoin. You can't buy anything the
    factory doesn't sell, and if you're blacklisted by the factory,
    since all you hold is suddenly worthless WorkCoin, you can't do
    anything except slowly starve in the dark.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, <a
    href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/primary+secondary?title=Truck%20Act"
    target="_new">laws were passed in the 19th Century</a>
    to prevent this practice, beginning with the <a
    href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4/1-2/37/contents/enacted"
    target="_new">Truck Act of 1831</a>. The original Act
    was modified a few times, most notably in <a
    href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/59-60/44/contents/enacted"
    target="_new">1896 to broaden the scope of workers
    covered,</a> <a
    href="https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1906/feb/27/the-law-of-truck"
    target="_new">1906 to cover deductions from wages</a>,
    and <a
    href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1974/1887/contents/made"
    target="_new">1974 to permit payment by cheque</a>.
    Essentially the basis of the law is that every employee can
    demand to be paid in "Coin of the Realm", and not by other
    means.</p> <p>It seems to me interesting that
    crypto bros are basically re-inventing the history of finance,
    one catastrophe at a time, so I'm watching with interest to see
    when they get to this one. Pass the
    popcorn!</p>
