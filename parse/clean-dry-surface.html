<h1>Clean Dry Surface</h1>

<p>So, you may well ask, how come I,
    a Mac user since Apple was doomed, unboxing a Surface Laptop 4?
    That’s a good question, and one that has a number of
    answers.</p> <p>The first bit is of course why not
    an M-series Apple MacBook Pro, like I bought last time. And
    that’s actually part of it - I bought a MBP, but I bought the
    one with the TouchBar (now dropped), the Butterfly Keyboard
    (notoriously fragile), and USB-C only, so no MagSafe power for
    me.</p> <p>I used that machine quite heavily for a
    good while, but then the inevitable happened, and I ended up
    back at the Apple Store having it repaired. Since then I’ve
    kind of fallen out of happiness with it. If it breaks again,
    I’m on the hook for repairs. The final straw was that it was
    too old to get Sonoma. I wasn’t worried because lockdown had
    happened, and I wasn’t in the office 5 days a week any more. So
    I bought a thumping great big desktop, and I use that for
    everything. Since you ask, an M1 Mac Studio with 64GB of RAM
    and 1TB of SSD storage. It’s
    <strong>rapid</strong>.</p> <p>But then
    there are times when you’re on the move. So I resigned myself
    to using the MBP, fingers crossed, and that was fine. All
    good.</p> <p>So then my Mom’s laptop battery died.
    And, like all good Moms, she made a replacement computer my
    problem. And I wondered what to get. She tried my MBP, but
    decided she didn’t like it, so a Windows PC was needed. And
    just as I was starting to wonder what on Earth I could do, an
    email from Microsoft arrived, bearing the great news of
    <em>refurbished</em> Surface Laptop 4s. Work has
    just lent me a Surface Laptop 5, so I was prepared to check the
    specs on these. And they are (or were) a stonking deal. This
    machine was originally £1248, but I got it for £560. That’s
    less than half price for a factory refurbished machine. And
    yeah, I bought one for my Mom as well.</p> <h2
    id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h2>
    <p>The first interesting thing was that I had to sign in
    to my Microsoft account to buy it. But interestingly, the
    computer showed up in there before I actually had it, so I
    haven’t had to register it. That is definitely a premium
    experience, and a suprise.</p> <p>It turned up in a
    few days, in a small but really heavy box. I was a bit
    concerned with that, because I was hoping to buy a machine that
    I’d only ever use away from my desk.</p> <p>Opening
    the box revealed a cool plain white box. Opening
    <em>that</em> revealed some astonishingly premium
    packaging. The computer was swathed in protective plastic, at
    the top of the box. Underneath that was a nice tray, holding
    the power supply and a small envelope with the Getting Started
    guide. Which I haven’t read.</p> <p>It all looked
    really properly premium. I began to see where the money had
    gone, and I was actually quite happy with what I had. The power
    supply is tiny, smaller than the MBP’s one, and has a few
    lovely touches. It has a USB-A charging port on it, which
    always amazes me as just such an obvious thing to do. The power
    connector attaches via magnets, which means it just pops off
    when the kitten jumps on your desk. Although it charges over
    USB-C as well, meaning I need only one charger for both
    laptops. Or that I can charge it off my monitor. The cables are
    a bit short, but that’s literally the only nit I can pick with
    it.</p> <p>My other first impressions are also
    positive. The trackpad is lovely and big, although it’s
    top-hinged, so clicks near the top aren’t great. It’s really
    responsive though. Similarly, the keyboard looks like every
    other laptop keyboard, but it feels nice. The travel is decent,
    the keys are well spaced for a 13.5" machine and all good. The
    only oddity is that the power button isn’t at the top right,
    it’s one key in from there. No biggie. The screen is bright and
    clear, with reasonable bezels. The camera is in the usual
    place, top centre on the screen, and the only weird thing here
    is that it doesn’t have a shutter on it. I’ve never worried
    about that one. The one downer was that there’s no thumbscoop
    on the front to open it, so it felt a bit like I was peeling a
    sandwich apart to open it. I daresay I’ll get used to
    that.</p> <p>Overall, if Microsoft is saying that
    this is what a laptop should be like, I agree. Everything is
    nice, even the Sandstone colour I got because they were the
    only 16GB ones available at the time looks nice, better than it
    seemed from the pictures online. Unlike the black ones, the
    keys aren’t exactly the same colour as the case, but I’m happy
    with it. And the backlight (off be default) looks
    nice.</p> <h2 id="oobe">OOBE</h2>
    <p>OK, let’s fire it up and see what happens. Of course,
    it’s got Windows 11 on it. I’m not super-familiar with Windows
    11. My work laptop is still Windows 10, because it’s part of a
    corporate build experience. I’m guessing I’ll get an upgrade at
    some point before Windows 10 goes EOL.</p> <p>So,
    into the Out-Of-Box Experience. Big positives - I have never
    ever had a Windows machine just boot into UK settings. This one
    did. First up, network connectivity. Select a network, enter
    the key, and away. I started on my guest network because I can
    remember the password for that.</p> <p>Right, a few
    updates, and we’re away. License agreement, all good (I hope I
    haven’t just signed away my kidneys or something). Next up,
    sign in with my Microsoft account. OK, no problem. It did the
    seemingly usual thing now of asking for the username, then
    pinging my phone with a 2FA code. Um, OK. Again, living up to
    the lovely premium experience, it asked if I wanted to restore
    from another machine, listing my Windows 10 gaming machine and
    a VM I’d built for work. I didn’t want that, I wanted a new
    machine, so I selected that. It asked about Find My Device (yes
    please) and diagnostic data (if I must), and some other data
    sharing stuff (eh, I suppose).</p> <p>And then at
    this point, the premium experience came to a screeching halt.
    The next screen asked about “Allowing apps to use my
    advertising ID”! <strong>Really</strong>? I haven’t
    even finished setting this machine up and it’s asking about
    adverts. Yuk.</p> <p>Then back to what you’d expect
    - do I want to back up to OneDrive? No, I’ll sort that, thanks.
    Oh, and then it asked if I wanted Microsoft Basic. Erm, more
    storage, “ad-free Outlook”, and access to support experts. And
    this had me going “What the actual heck, Microsoft? I bought a
    premium machine, and you’re going to serve me adverts in
    Outlook?” Wow. It also tried to sell me on Microsoft 365
    Personal (no thanks, I get that through work), and Game Pass
    (no thanks, I’ve got Steam). A few more updates, and at last I
    could log in. Yay!</p> <h2
    id="updates">Updates</h2> <p>We’ve checked for
    updates twice already, but here we go. I knew that Windows
    doesn’t immediately patch itself up to date, but waits for a
    week before blamming you with the full package. But I wanted
    this machine up to date as fast as possible, so I went off to
    Windows Update and told it to go check.</p>
    <p>There are <strong>a lot</strong> of
    updates.</p> <p>After it seemingly making no
    progress on updates for an hour, but asking for a reboot, I
    decided to reboot it. It’s now got a spinner made of circles
    moving in a circular path and a message saying “Updates are
    underway”. Oh, it’s rebooting. And it’s back, way less than the
    four minutes.</p> <p>And… it’s downloading more
    updates. The firmware ones are now listed as "Update failed.
    Oh,and it wants to restart, but it’s seemingly downloading
    another update. Let’s restart.</p> <p>Oh, and now
    the firmware updates have installed, and need a restart. So
    let’s do that.</p> <p>Oh, and now I’ve got a screen
    that says “Please wait while we install a system update”, so
    I’m guessing this is the firmware.</p> <p>I get
    that I deliberately pushed the updates, but so far this thing
    has been out of the box for two hours, and all it’s done is the
    OOBE and update itself. It’s just as well I have a sensible
    machine to hand for the work I need to do.</p>
    <p>And now it’s finally downloading the last update.
    We’re now at 2h30 out of box and it’s installing yet another
    update. This looks like the last one, but it seems a lot
    scruffier than macOS just doing everything in one. And, since
    the hardware and software come from the same company, you’d
    expect it to be more streamlined. And this update is stuck on
    “Installing - 25%” so I’m guessing it’ll be a while.</p>
    <p>Restarting… updates are under way, and now it’s got a
    progress indicator. That’s nice, and it’s a visible percentage,
    not just a flood bar. It did an auto-reboot in the middle of
    the update process, so now it should be up and ready for use,
    only three hours after I took it out of the box.</p>
    <p>Time to start installing applications.</p>
    <p>Nice feature is that it did the firmware updates as
    part of the process, without my needing to download a separate
    firmware installer or anything. Not so nice was that never
    actually said what firmware it was updating, and there were
    three firmware updates.</p> <h2
    id="ready-to-play">Ready to Play</h2> <p>So,
    according to my notes, we’re something like three hours after
    unboxing and it’s ready to go. Into the Microsoft Store we go,
    looking for apps. I found and installed Firefox, iCloud for
    Windows, and a few others. I discovered “winget” a while ago,
    so i thought I’d put that on and use that to install a bunch of
    apps in one go while I work on another machine.</p>
    <p>And yeah, that all went well.</p>
    <p>Somewhere around here, I noticed that I hadn’t enabled
    tabbed windows in Explorer. I’d had them for ages on my work
    machines, so I struggled to understand why I didn’t have them
    here.</p> <p>This led me down a pathway. Tabbed
    explorer windows were introduced somewhere around 22H2, so I
    should have them. But I don’t. Why not…?</p> <p>So
    I’ve got a brand new (to me) machine out of the box, and I find
    it’s got Windows 11 version 21H2 on it. But that version is end
    of life. It might be what the machine came with originally, but
    it sure as heck is bad now. It’s so old that it won’t update,
    but there’s nothing to warn me that my OS is dangerously out of
    date. Equally, it’s telling me it’s fully patched and there’s
    no actions I need to take.</p> <p>I’d decided
    originally to write this as a kind of faux-naif, innocent
    abroad kind of thing. But now I have a serious problem. This
    machine won’t upgrade to Windows 11, but neither will it
    actually <strong>work</strong> with a supported
    operating system, because there is no apparent way to upgrade.
    I ended up asking for help.</p> <h3
    id="sidebar---fixing-the-update">Sidebar - Fixing the
    update</h3> <p>The advice I got didn’t work. In the
    end, I went with the “thermonuclear” suggestion of attempting
    an in-place upgrade. Yes, from Windows 11 to Windows 11. No
    problem, I launched the “Upgrade Assistant”, and ran that. That
    asked me to download and run the “PC Upgrade Advisor”, and
    refresh the window when done. So I did, and the PC Upgrade
    advisor kindly told me that my PC would run Windows 11. Which
    wasn’t a suprise, because it was, you know, <em>running
    Windows 11</em> already. Following that, I refreshed the
    Upgrade Assistant, and that kicked off the upgrade. One long
    download later, it began the upgrade process. And an hour or so
    later, I had Windows 11 version 23H2, which is the current,
    supported version. But that was a heck of a process, including
    the Upgrade Assistant not having the smarts to say “Oh yeah,
    this person is doing a version upgrade, so they don’t need the
    advisor”.</p> <h2 id="back-in-the-room">Back In The
    Room</h2> <p>So yeah, I’ve got a supported computer
    now. There were (you guessed it) updates to get my computer up
    to date, but they completed without further hassle. The
    firmware upgrades went through as well, once the battery had
    charged enough. And I have tabbed Explorer windows. Goodness
    only knows how long I’d have run an unsupported OS before
    spotting that one, especially as Windows Update didn’t warn me
    or offer any updates.</p> <p>And now we’re off to
    the races. I installed a few useful things from the Microsoft
    Store, including iCloud for Windows. I didn’t expect that, but
    it actually fixes one of the things I was most worried about. I
    use iCloud for password management, and being able to have my
    password sync onto here is really useful. I’d like to think
    that my WiFi passwords would be available too, but I’m not
    holding out much hope on that one.</p> <h2
    id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>So, the
    Surface Laptop 4 is a really nice machine. If this is what
    Microsoft thinks a laptop should be like, I’d have to say that
    I agree. The main things I’ve come to like are:</p>
    <ul class="incremental"> <li><p>Nice
    keyboard</p></li> <li><p>Good
    speakers</p></li> <li><p>Great screen,
    which works well with the dynamic scaling - I’ve gone from the
    default 150% to 125%, but I still miss my 4K desktop
    screen.</p></li> <li><p>Windows
    Hello</p></li> </ul> <p>The main thing
    I dislike is:</p> <ul class="incremental">
    <li>Windows 11</li> </ul> <p>There’s
    some “meh” stuff as well. On closer inspection, the machine
    shows in my Microsoft account as black, when it’s actually
    sandstone. I get that this is a
    <strong>very</strong> minor nitpick, but when
    you’re used to Apple and their tendency to just get things like
    this right, it takes a bit of polish off. I don’t know if I can
    change it, and to be fair, it shows as a Surface Laptop, where
    my other machine just shows as a generic laptop. The power
    button isn’t in the top right corner, it’s one button in, with
    “Del” right at the edge. This hasn’t bothered me. Oh, and the
    screen brightness seems a bit twitchy - you can see it fade up
    and down sometimes, which I’ve not noticed on any other
    machine.</p> <p>It’s going to take a bit of getting
    used to, but since I use a fair bit of Microsoft software
    anyway, the learning curve is less painful. VS Code runs just
    as well, I use WSL for command line stuff, as I’m much more
    familiar with a UNIX command line than PowerShell. It’s not a
    drop-in replacement for my MBP, but it’s a worthy successor to
    it, and for less than half what a new Apple machine would have
    cost, I’m happy. I don’t travel much any more, but I think this
    machine will be nice to travel with and nice to have
    around.</p> <p>I wonder if the Surface Pen works
    with it. It’d be nice to think it does, because there are times
    when I just want to draw. I need to get used to having a touch
    screen as well. My MBP obviously didn’t have one, my last work
    laptop didn’t either, and so I need to see how that’s going to
    work for me.</p> <p>The other thing I should
    confess is that I actually bought two of these. One of them is
    going to my Mom, who needed a new machine. Installing hers took
    more like three hours than all day, because I’d alreay tripped
    over the process of needing to do the in-place W11 upgrade. I’m
    sure she’ll be happy with hers. Having compared my sandstone
    with the black machine I got for Mom, I actually prefer the
    sandstone.</p> <p>My new work laptop is also a
    Surface Laptop, but that’s a 5 rather than a 4. It’s also got a
    corporate W10 build on it, so I haven’t bothered comparing it
    with mine. The corporate build has a bunch of different
    problems, so I’m just not going to worry about it.</p>
    <p>Onwards and upwards!</p>
